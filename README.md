Wizdom Nuel
Software Developer

I am a software developer with 3+ years of experience building reliable, scalable, and user-focused applications. I work across the full software development stack and focus on turning ideas into production-ready systems that solve real problems.

I care about clean architecture, system design, and long-term maintainability. I do not build demos for the sake of it, I build software meant to ship and scale.

Areas of Focus

Backend & API Development

System Design & Scalable Architectures

Blockchain Development (Smart Contracts, Web3, Decentralized Applications)

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

Data-driven and product-oriented engineering

Current Work & Learning

I am actively deepening my work in AI engineering and blockchain technologies, with a focus on building secure, intelligent, and scalable systems that can support real-world products and businesses.

Collaboration

I am open to collaborating on serious projects, early-stage products, and long-term technical initiatives where engineering quality and execution matter.
